# SHSS
SHSS has screen savers!

# Set Up

After unpacking the tar ball, type the command below:

To open the module launcher or just type the module name anywhere, anytime in your terminal!

If you have an idea for a module, or already have source code and a compiled program, I'll be glad to add it to SHSS!
