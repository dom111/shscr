# SHSS
SHSS has screen savers!

# Set Up

Move all the files from the tar ball to ```/bin``` using ```mv``` or ```cp```

# Modules

* ```astro```:  simple star field with random star placements
* ```blank```:  makes the entire terminal blank
* ```confetti```:  slowy fills the terminal with randomly selected and colored symbols
* ```fconfetti```:  ```confetti```, but it runs faster
* ```fmatrix```: ```matrix```, but it runs faster
* ```matrix```:  slowly fills the terminal with random ones and zeros
* ```snake```:  a "snake" of the users choice color slowly consumes the terminal
* ```vastro```:  ```astro```, with dimmness in some stars (This is my favorite module!)
* ```vrain```:  random shades of blue rain fall on the terminal
* ```rpix```:  randomly colored "pixels"
* ```rblock```:  randomly colored "blocks"
* ```planitis```:  similar to vastro, but with planets, not stars
* ```tvsnow```:  TV static in the terminal, based on the snow screensaver for DOS
* ```ltvsnow```:  ```tvsnow``` for larger monitors
* ```gook```:  slowy prints out random letters, numbers, and the occasional space
* ```gookn```:  ```gook``` with a ```\n``` every so often
* ```dotfill```:  slowly fills the screen with multicolored dots (Another favorite!)

If you have an idea for a module, or already have source code and a compiled program, I'll be glad to add it to SHSS!
